[abstract]
SDK doctor helps diagnose application-server-side connectivity issues with your Couchbase Cluster (among other things).
 
 
SDK doctor is a tool to diagnose application-server-side connectivity issues with your Couchbase Cluster   .
It makes the same connections to the Couchbbase Server cluster that Couchbase SDKs make during bootstrapping, and then reports on the state of the connections made -- giving diagnostic information that can help to solve puzzling network issues.
 
Couchbase SDKs work best when on the same local area network as your Couchbase Server cluster.
Developing locally, against a remote cluster -- particularly a Cloud-hosted one -- can lead to timeout problems.
SDK doctor is particularly useful for '` 
 
 
 == Installation
 
 
The build steps are similar to most go programs.  Given a properly set up go build environment:

[source,console]
----
$ go get github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor

[source,console]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
----

[source,console]
----
$ go build
----

[source,console]
----
$ ./sdk-doctor  diagnose --help
----
 
[TIP]
If the `cd` of the second step returns an error because your `GOPATH` is not correctly set, you will probably find that it has defaulted to ~.
So 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/go/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
----



== Use

A full example can be found on our xref:3.0@java-sdk:howtos:troubleshooting-cloud-connections.adoc#validating-connectivity-with-sdk-doctor[Troublesmooting Cloud Connections] page.
 

== Limitations

SDK doctor will not work with _Alternate Address_, unless the external ports are set as the default on the Server.

Some of the DNS complints are noise.
